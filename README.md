# Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence - CIC IPN

This repository contains exercises, assignments, and tests from the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence course at Centro de Investigación en Computación, Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CIC IPN), taught by Dr. Salvador Godoy.

## About the Course

The course focuses on symbolic artificial intelligence, exploring its principles and applications. `Symbolic AI` is based on high-level representations of knowledge and reasoning, often leveraging formal logic and rule-based systems.

### Why Prolog?

All exercises in this repository were implemented using `Prolog`, a logic programming language well-suited for symbolic AI due to:

- Its `non-deterministic` nature, allowing efficient exploration of search spaces.
- The `inference engine`, enabling powerful `unification` operations.
- The ability to define `rules and relationships declaratively`.
